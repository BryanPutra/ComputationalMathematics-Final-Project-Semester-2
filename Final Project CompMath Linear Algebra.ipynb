    "# Eigenvalue Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, eigendecomposition or sometimes spectral decomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Only diagonalizable matrices can be factorized in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties of Eigendecomposition:**\n",
    "1. The determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n",
    "2. The trace of A is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues.\n",
    "3. The eigenvalues of the $A^{-1}$ are the $\\lambda^{-1}_i$.\n",
    "4. The eigenvalues of $A^n$ are $\\lambda^n_i$.\n",
    "5. In general, the eigenvalues of $f(A)$ are $f(λ_i)$.\n",
    "6. The eigenvectors of $A^{−1}$ are the same as the eigenvectors of $A$.\n",
    "7. If $A$ is hermitian (its conjugate transpose is equal to itself) and full-rank (all rows or columns are linearly independent), then the eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal (the dot-product between any two eigenvectors is zero) and the eigenvalues are real.\n",
    "8. $A$ is invertible if all its eigenvalues are different from zero and vice-versa.\n",
    "9. If the eigenvalues of matrix $A$ are distinct (not repeated), then $A$ can be eigendecomposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how this decomposition is done, let matrix A be the matrix being operated on.\n",
